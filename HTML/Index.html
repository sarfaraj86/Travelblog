                The city’s nucleus was a settlement around a mud fort, built in 1537 by a local chief, Kempe Gowda. The fort was reconstructed of stone in 1761. Bangalore was the headquarters of the British administration from 1831 to 1881, when the raja was restored. However, Britain retained an administrative and military presence in the city until Indian independence in 1947. Bangalore subsequently became the capital of the new state of Mysore and remained the capital during the reorganization of states in 1956; Mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1973.

                A famous landmark is the Prakasam barrage, the 1223.5 long modern regulator and Road Bridge across the Krishna River, completed in 1957. Its panoramic lake and the three canals that run through the city give Vijayawada a Venetian appearance. Kanaka Durga, goddess of power, riches and benevolence is considered the presiding deity of Vijayawada. The temple is set on Indrakeela Hill. A temple of Lord Malleswara is also within the city area.

                The Mughal dynasty practically came to an end when in 1803, the native rulers defeated by General Lake of East India Company near Patparganj. The East India appointed first resident of Delhi as the 'Protector' of battered Mughal crown. In the early years the British and their troops settled within the walled city around the Red Fort and Kashmere Gate. The city underwent drastic transformations after the war of 1857. One third of the city was razed to rubble in 1858 and the East India Company transferred the rule to the British Crown.
